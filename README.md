# predict-future-sales-R
In this project, we will be exploring the dataset consisting daily sales data of various items from a list of shops. From the data provided, we will attempt to predict the total amount of every item sold in every shop for the next month.
Being able to predict the future sales figures is useful as it allows for planning of strategies to increase the sales of a company. For example, if a product is identified as more popular than others, decisions can be made, such as to increase the price of the product to generate more revenue or place popular items at shops with higher sales.
